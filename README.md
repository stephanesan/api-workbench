# API Workbench

API Workbench, a rich, full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for designing, building, testing, documenting and sharing RESTful HTTP APIs. It supports both RAML 0.8 and the recently launched RAML 1.0. [RAML](http://raml.org) makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design to sharing.

NOTE: This version includes a [hack](https://github.com/stephanesan/api-workbench/commit/fa532a4efcad07f8ca789c2b31a470b268f9393b) to resolve json-schema dependencies on the local filesystem.
